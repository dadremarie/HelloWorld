 * The ArrayPlotter class provides methods for drawing in
 *    a grid by setting the boolean values of a 2D array.
 *
 *    Each drawing method must
 *    - take zero arguments,
 *    - have a void return type, and
 *    - have a name that conforms to the on...ButtonClick format.
 *      (This restriction allows the GridPlotterGUI to recognize methods,
 *       for which it automatically generates buttons.)
